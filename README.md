For the code to work you need to move the h5 file inside the training scripts folder.
See the .gitignore to find the path that the file is required to be in. 

also note that all the contents from models folder are ignored as there is no need to transfer this. Just run transfer from orion first and you should get the model.

also note that inside orion you need to navigate inside the traing_scripts path for the output_logs to find the correct folder.
