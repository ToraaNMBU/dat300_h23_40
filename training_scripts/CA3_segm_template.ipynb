This is the biggest assignemnt of the semester, and therefore you get two weeks to work on it. However, we reccomend that **you start early**. This assignment has three semi-big sections, each of which build upon the last. So if you delay the assignment until the day before submission, you will most likely fail. This assignment is completed by doing the following. \n",

    "# Introduction \n",
    "This assignment will center around semantic segmentation of the dataset in the TGS salt identification challenge. Several of the Earths accumulations of oil and gas **also** have huge deposits of salt, which is easier to detect than the actual hydrocarbons. However, knowing where the salt deposits are precisely is still quite difficult, and segmentation of the seismic images is still something that requires expert interpretation of the images. This leads variable, and highly subjective renderings. To create more accurate, objective segmentations TGS (the worlds leading geoscience data company) have created this challenge to determine if a deep learning model is up to the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "In this assigmnet you will be given 3500 annotated images. The image, and mask dimensions are 128x128 pixels. With each image there follows an annotation mask where each pixel is classified as `1` (salt deposit) or `0` not salt deposit. The test-dataset contains 500 images, where no ground truth masks are given. To evualuate your model on the test dataset, submit your predictions to the Kaggle leaderboard.\n",
